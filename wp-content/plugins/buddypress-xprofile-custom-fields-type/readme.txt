Add more custom fields type to extended profiles in Buddypress: Birthdate, Email, Web, Datepicker, ...

== Description ==

Buddypress installation required!! With Buddypress 1.7, I'm using a new hook "bp_custom_profile_edit_fields_pre_visibility" if you don't have it in your edit profile form or register page, the fields should not appear. Check this if the fields don't appear and you are using Buddypress 1.7.
Add more custom fields type to extended profiles in buddypress: Birthdate, Email, Web, Datepicker, Custom post type, Multi custom post type, checkbox acceptance, image, file, colorpicker, number. 
We add now a new visibility setting 'Nobody' to create fields hidden to all members of buddypress.
Works with <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-xprofile-custom-fields-type/" title="BP Profile Search">BP Profile Search plugin</a> searching birthdate and age range.
If you need more fields type, you are free to add them yourself or request me at miguel@donmik.com.
I've moved this plugin to <a href="https://github.com/donmik/buddypress-xprofile-custom-fields-type">github</a>, you can contribute now.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why my fields are not showing ? =

If you are using Buddypress 1.7, you need to check if you have the new hook "bp_custom_profile_edit_fields_pre_visibility". Check in your edit.php (/your-theme/members/single/profile/edit.php, if this page is not in your theme, check in buddypress plugin in bp-themes/bp-default folder) and register page (/your-theme/registration/register.php, if this page is not in your theme, check bp-default theme of buddypress plugin) if this line of code: `<?php do_action ( 'bp_custom_profile_edit_fields_pre_visibility' ); ?>`. If you don't see it, you must add it just before the code of visibility settings.

= Can I modify how the fields value are showned? =

Yes, you can, since version 1.5.4, I have added a filter called "bxcft_show_field_value". You can use it and modify the value of your fields. For example, if you need to show only the day or month of the birthdate you need to add this code below in the functions.php of your theme:

`add_filter( 'bxcft_show_field_value', 'my_show_field', 15, 4);
function my_show_field($value_to_return, $type, $id, $value) {
    $value_to_return = $value;
    if ($value_to_return == '')
        return $value_to_return;
    $value_to_return = $value;
    if ($type == 'birthdate') {
        $value = str_replace("<p>", "", $value);
        $value = str_replace("</p>", "", $value);
        $field = new BP_XProfile_Field($id);
        // Get children.
        $childs = $field->get_children();
        $show_age = false;
        if (isset($childs) && $childs && count($childs) > 0) {
            // Get the name of custom post type.
            if ($childs[0]->name == 'show_age')
                $show_age = true;
        }
        if ($show_age) {
            return '<p>'.floor((time() - strtotime($value))/31556926).'</p>';
        }
        return '<p>'.date_i18n( 'F j' , strtotime($value) ).'</p>';
    }
    return $value_to_return;
}`

= Where are my images or files uploaded? =

Your files are uploaded in "YOUR_UPLOAD_DIR / profiles / ID_OF_USER" folder.

= How can I put description text below my field's label ? =

For now, you can use javascript to do this. Write this javascript at the end of your template file (register.php for example).

`// For each description we have.
jQuery('p.description').each(function() {
    // Clone description.
    // Looking for parent div.
    // Looking for label of checkbox field or radio field first.
    var desc = jQuery(this).clone(),
        parent = jQuery(this).parent(),
        label = parent.find('span.label');
    // If there is no label of checkbox field or radio field, we look for normal labels.
    if (!label.length) {
        label = parent.find('label');
    }
    // If there is a label.
    if (label.length) {
        // Putting the description after the label.
        label.after(desc);
        // Removing the original description.
        jQuery(this).remove();
    }
});`

= I've removed the filter that make clickable the profile fields, but with this plugin the links are still there ? =

With my plugin, you need to use this code to hide the links of profile fields:

`function remove_xprofile_links() {
    remove_filter( 'bp_get_the_profile_field_value', 'xprofile_filter_link_profile_data', 9, 2 );
}
add_action('bp_setup_globals', 'remove_xprofile_links');`

= How to limit the size of image or file uploads ? =
In the function "bxcft_updated_profile", after this code:
`// Handles image field type saving.
if (isset($_FILES['field_'.$field_id]) && $_FILES['field_'.$field_id]['size'] > 0 .......here......... ) {...`
Thanks to borisnov for this tip.
